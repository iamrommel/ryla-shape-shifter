# ryla-shape-shifter
A simple shape and color game for kids. 

I decided to create a game for my daughter (Ryla) to learn shapes and colors. I know there are tons of same apps are available but i want it to be Ryla specific. And just to have fun about react-native animations, colors, audio, drag-and-drap functionalities
